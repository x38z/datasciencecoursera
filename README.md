# Data cleaning for Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset
## Initial dataset 
##The dataset includes the following files:
##=========================================

##- 'README.txt'

##- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

##- 'features.txt': List of all features.

##- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

##- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

##- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

##- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

##- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

## The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

##- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

### The script was processing observation files x_test and x_train and was merging them with subjects and activity subsets.
### Avareges (MEAN) were calculated per each activity and each subject line for each SRD and MEAN observation.
